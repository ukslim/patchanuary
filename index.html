<h1>Patchanuary</h1>

<p><b>Patchanuary</b> has a minimum viable website.</p>

<p>Inspired by projects such as <a href="https://inktober.com/">Inktober</a>, the idea is to create a sound inspired by a prompt word, each day of January.</p>

<p>The sound could be a one-shot sound effect, a playable synth patch, a melody, a long ambient piece, or whatever else you want. One way to create the sounds might
be to configure a synthesiser patch - but there are no rules to say that's the only way.</p>

<p>One approach to Patchanuary is to share each day's sound on social media - why not use the hashtag <code>#patchanuary</code> - but of course you are free to do whatever you like.

<h2>Draft prompts</h2>

<p>I'm working on it and seeking suggestions. Some of the following may be dropped. Order will be randomised before January.</p>
